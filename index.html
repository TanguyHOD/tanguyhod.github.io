<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is Tanguy HODONOU, I have been living in France for the past 6 years. I did my undergraduate studies in economics and management at Clermont Auvergne University. Today, I am nearing the end of my Economics Engineering and Data Analysis Master's at CY Cergy Paris University, France. Currently searching for a data science internship that allows me to build tools using visualization and machine learning to help people explore and understand their data.
<br><br>

I maintain a list of machine learning projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="">Github profile.</a><br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae in French</a>
and in english <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>.</p>
