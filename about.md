I am a data scientist junior with background in mathematics and economics, that helps me crack down complex issues in the field of analytics. Dynamic, team player with a good basis of computer science and development tools I can help your company transform and interpret data.
After two successful experiences at ARAFER and **AXA** as a data scientist intern where I used **Python** Excel and **R** I am now available for a new challenging project.
