I define myself as data scientist with a background in economics. I enjoy machine learning, web programming, and 
all things data science and applying statistical learning to various topics. Today, I am nearing the end of my Economics Engineering and Data Analysis Master's at CY Cergy Paris University, France. I committed to learning everything I could about machine learning, data science, Business Intelligence and the tech industry.
I am seeking now for an internship as a data scientist that will allow me to use machine learning and statistical 
methods for decision making.
